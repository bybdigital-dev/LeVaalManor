Build a clean, modern, and fully responsive ONE-PAGE website for a luxury short-term rental called Le Vaal Manor, located on Parys Golf Estate, South Africa.

The website must behave as a single-page application (SPA):

Only the Home section is visible on initial page load

Other sections (About, Gallery, Amenities, Contact) are hidden by default

When a user selects a menu item from the navigation (dropdown or menu), the corresponding section becomes visible and replaces the Home content without loading a new page

Smooth transitions between sections (fade or slide)

Website Purpose
